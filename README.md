# policyAI

To test policies in modern governments usually takes years or even decades and centuries. People can hold grudges and be gullible and force their ideals onto their children. To combat this, here we (**_almost_**) have a policy testing engine! A number of independant agents will have the ability to vote for politicians that last for certain terms and will implement certain policies. Each agent will have a number of attributes that will affect which politicians they vote for, and each will have a short and long term memory to learn from its mistakes.
